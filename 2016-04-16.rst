Debugging Heisenbugs
--------------------

"Heisenbugs are mentally difficult for programmers to deal with. It is very
frustrating to have something that eludes clear methodical debugging, and where
you are forced into speculation, experiments and even debugging based on vague
statistics. But a single Heisenbug can derail a project, especially if it is
not addressed as soon as possible."

A hardened Android port, but will be curious about its survival if Google does
